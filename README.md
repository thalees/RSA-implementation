## Concecpt

The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.

The RSA algorithm is named after those who invented it in 1978: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

### Generating the keys

1. Select two large prime numbers, x and y. The prime numbers need to be large so that they will be difficult for someone to figure out.
2. Calculate n = x * y
3. Calculate the totient function: Ï•(n) = (xâˆ’1)*(yâˆ’1)
4. Select an integer *e*, such that *e* is co-prime to Ï•(n) and 1 < e < Ï•(n). The pair of numbers (n,e) makes up the public key.
> Two integers are co-prime if the only positive integer that divides them is 1.

5. Calculate `d` such that `e.d = 1 mod Ï•(n)`

Add can be found using the extended euclidean algorithm. The pair (n,d) makes up the private key.

### Encryption
Given a plaintext P, represented as a number, the ciphertext C is calculated as:

`C = P^e mod n`

### Decryption
Using the private key (n,d), the plaintext can be found using:

`P = C^d mod n`

## Installation and Requirements

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. Before we install the application we need these tools configured and installed:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

It is very easy to install and upload the application. Just follow the steps below and everything will be fine! ðŸŽ‰

### Application

Initially download the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/thalees/RSA-implementation.git
cd RSA-implementation
```

After cloning that repository, create a virtualenv and activate:
```
python -m virtualenv venv && . venv/bin/activate
```

Finally install the necessary dependencies::
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

After performing the initial setup, just run the application:
```
python cli.py
```

## Tests

To run the tests, just run the command below:
```
pytest rsa_implementation_test.py
```
